ΤΟ MR. HOBBES.

Ι

VAs'r bodies of philosophy
I oft have seen and read3
But all are bodies dead,
Or bodies by art fashioned.
I never yet the living soul could see,
But in thy books and thee.
'Tis onely God ean know
Whether the fair idea thou dost show
Agree entirely with his own or no.
This I dare boldly tell,

’Tis so like truth‚ ’twill serve our turn as well.

Just, as in Nature, thy proportions be,
As full of concord their varietie,

As firm the parts upon their center rest,
And all so solid are, that they at least
As much as Nature emptiness detest.
