ΤΟ MR. HOBBES· V

IV.

‘The Baltick, Euxine, and the Caspian,
And slender-limb’d Mediterraneum
Seem narrow creeks to thee, and onely fit
For the poor wretched fisher-boats of wit.
Thy nobler vessel the vast ocean tries,
And nothing sees but seas and skies‚
Till unknown regions it descries;
Thou great Columbus of the golden lands of new philosophies.
Thy task was harder much than his,
For thy learn'd America is
· Not onely found out first by thee,
And rudely left to future industrie ;
But thy eloquenoe and thy wit
Has planted, peopled, built, and civiliz'd it.

V.

I little thought before,
(Nor being my own self so poor,
Could eomprehend so vast a store)
That all the wardrobe of rich eloquence
Could have afforded half enuff,
Of bright, of new, and lasting stuff,
To cloath the mighty limbs of thy gigantie sense.
Thy solid reason, like the shield from heaven
To the Trojan heroe given, ”
Τοο strong to take a mark from any mortal dart,
Yet shines with gold and gems in every part,
And wonders on it grav’d by the learn’d hand of art3
A shield that gives delight
Even to the enemies sight,
Then when they're sure to lose the combat by't.
