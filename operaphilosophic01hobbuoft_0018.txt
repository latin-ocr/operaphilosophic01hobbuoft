TO MR. HOBBES.

VI.

Nor can the snow which now cold age does shed
Upon thy reverend head,
Quench 01· allay the noble fires within ;
But all which thou hast bin,
And all that youth can be, thou’rt yet;
So sully still dost thou
Enjoy the manhood and the bloom of wit,
And all the natural heat, but not the sever too.
So contraries on AEtna’s top conspire;
Here hoary frosts, and by them breaks out fire.
A secure peace the faithful neighbours keep3
Th' emboldened snow next to the flame does sleep.
And if we weigh, like thee,
Nature, and causes, we shall see
That thus it needs must be;
To things immortal time can do no wrong3
And that, which never is to die, for ever must be young.

ABRAHAM COWLEY.

IN THO. HOBBES.

 

Fn‘r1L1s exornet barbatos pompa magistros,
Et schola discipulos cogat inepta leves:
Affulsit nova lux tenebroso Hobbesius orbi.

Quanta est laus hominem restituisse sibi?
